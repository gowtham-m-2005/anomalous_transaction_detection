# anomalous_transaction_detection
## The Problem:
  ### Cyber Crime has been on the rise in the recent times and numerous scams are happening all around the world.You can have the best security in the world and still be social engineered.
  ### This Machine learning model aims to detect Anomalous Transactions and help the user in keeping their transactons under check.

## Target Solution:
  ### The Model is implemented within the admin portal of bank accounts which can detect anomalous transactions for a particular user with the press of a button.
  #### The included website aims to work as a mock site to 'fix' the position of our model on the tech stack

## Requiremnets:
  ### Dataset
    To reproduce this model,acquire the credit card fraud dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
  ### Required Libraries/Modules:
    pandas
    sklearn

## Algorithms Used:
  ### To Find Outliers:
    #### Isolation Forest - found to be faster than One-Class SVM
    #### One-Class SVM(Support Vector Machines)

  ### Classification Algorithms
  Trained and Tested with:
     Logistic Regression
     Decision Tree Classifier
